# Smart shopping cart - Based on Walmart's Problem Statement

## We have designed a **Smart Cart** which attempts to provide the customer a **trouble-free** shopping experience.

The cart has attached to it a *QR code scanner* which scans the items or products placed on the platform of the cart. Once the product is scanned only then the platform rotates(through its *servo motor*) to let the product slide onto the bottom of the cart. The details of the scanned products is shown to the customer on an android application. Finally the customer can checkout by paying for the items he has on his list.
